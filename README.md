# The-Matrix
Matrices and Markov chains are highly compatible due to the natural way matrices can represent the transitions and states within Markov chains. 
A Markov chain is a stochastic process that describes a sequence of possible events, where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event (memoryless property). 
Practical Example
Consider a weather prediction model where the weather can be sunny, cloudy, or rainy. The transition probabilities might be:
