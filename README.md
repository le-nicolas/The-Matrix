# The-Matrix
Matrices and Markov chains are highly compatible due to the natural way matrices can represent the transitions and states within Markov chains.

A Markov chain is a stochastic process that describes a sequence of possible events, where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event (memoryless property). 


Heres the deal... Gubot kay siya lantawon. so mas maayo jd kung i apply ang Matrix :D

Practical application:
Consider a weather prediction model where the weather can be sunny, cloudy, or rainy.
